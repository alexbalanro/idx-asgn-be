I've chosen Spring Boot for the backend as it provides a lot of tooling out of the box for creating and maintaining
a REST service and I'm also comfortable with this tool. For multiple calls to other services I've used the @Async
annotation along with Java's CompletableFuture class/utilities. Spring also provides an easy manner to interact
with other REST services with its RestTemplate class that's also easily mockable.

I've chosen Angular 7 as the framework for frond end as it's one that I've had experience with ( Worked with AngularJS )
It now provides easier scaffolding for the project and more intuitive separation of concerns through components/services
Tt's also based on TypeScript which closely resembles the Java language.
